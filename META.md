**How duplicates are identified?**

Marking a question as duplicate is part of the question closing procedure, except when a question is closed as duplicate, the title is appended with "[Duplicate]" rather than "[Closed]".

1. A question can be closed as duplicate with a single vote from a moderator or a user who has earned a gold tag badge in one of that question's current tags, unless that user participated in editing the tags.
2. Moderators and anyone with 3000 reputation may vote to close a question as a duplicate by clicking the "close" link and entering in the URL or title of the question they believe it to be a duplicate of.
3. It takes 5 close votes to reach the closing threshold.
4. A user may cast up to 50 close votes per day.

A vote to close as duplicate will automatically post a comment with the duplicate link if no one else had voted for that particular duplicate. The user who cast the vote is the owner of the comment and can edit or delete it like any other comment. The original question must have an answer; a user cannot mark a question as a duplicate of an unanswered one.

Once the question is closed as a duplicate, these comments are deleted and the duplicate information is automatically edited into the question itself. Some duplicate questions may eventually be deleted, but often they are left as a signpost pointing people towards the canonical answer to that question.

If a user sees a question and does not agree that it truly is a duplicate, he/she can edit it to highlight the differences, then try to get it reopened by casting a reopen vote.
